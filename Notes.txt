# Firewall Configuration
    - Firewall rules control incoming or outgoing traffic to an instance. 
1. Priority
    - Specify the order that a rule will be applied within a network. 
    - Rules with lower numbers get prioritized first. Default is 1000.
    - For example:
        - if there are multiple firewalls in the same machine, one firewall allows opening 8080 port, 
          another one allows closing 8080 port
            => firewall who has higher priority will be applied

2. Direction of traffic:
    - Ingress: limit others visit you via a specific port
    - Outgress: limit you visit others via a specific port 

3. Action on Match:
    - Allow: the written port will be allowed, others are not allowed
    - Deny: the written port will be denied, others will be allowed
    - Target tags:
        - Recommend to be the same as name as firewall to avoid manully unnecessary differentiation
        - the usage of firewall could depend on name or name of target tag, if they are the same, no need to differentiatiate them
    - IPv4 ranges:
        - Even if we limit the access via port, we could use IPv4 ranges to do further limitation
        - 0.0.0.0/0 - no limitation: all ranges can access the port

5. Protocols and Ports
    - Protocols: TCP
    - Ports: 
        1. 8080
            - During development, we need to rent a virtual machine, 
        2. 9200
            - Default port of ElasticSearch,
